TERMS AND CONDITIONS            (ReservesDirect License version 1.0)

1.   Version 2 of the GNU General Public License (the "GNU GPL") as
published by the Free Software Foundation shall apply to this software
except as specifically modified below.  All undefined terms used in
this agreement shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the GNU GPL,
which is incorporated into these terms and conditions by reference. If
you need a copy of the GNU GPL, please write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301.

2.  ReservesDirect is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but is distributed "AS IS" and WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, without even the
implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, and without any warranty as to non-infringement of any third
party's rights.  See Paragraph 12 of the GNU GPL for additional
details.   This disclaimer of warranty and the corresponding language
in the GNU GPL apply to the entirety of ReservesDirect including any
of its constituent elements that were not created by Emory University.
The developers of this software have, to the best of their knowledge,
only included third-party programs that are available for distribution
pursuant to the GNU GPL or equivalent open source licenses, but, as
noted, Emory University does not make and specifically disclaims any
warranty of non-infringement of any third party's rights.

3.  Please note that the ReservesDirect software manages electronic
reserves systems but does not evaluate or otherwise monitor the
content posted to address any potential legal concerns arising under
copyright or other applicable law.  We strongly encourage any
institution that decides to make use of this software to develop sound
policies and procedures for compliance with copyright and other
applicable law. By clicking "I Accept" and downloading this software,
(a) you acknowledge that you have been advised to put into place
appropriate policies and procedures for addressing potential legal
concerns arising from electronic course reserves systems; and (b) you
agree that neither Emory University nor the developers of this
software, including any individuals or institutions that contribute to
the development of the software in any way, are responsible for
ensuring that users of this software are operating within the
boundaries of copyright or other applicable law.  If you distribute,
duplicate, or otherwise disseminate ReservesDirect or any program
derived or based upon ReservesDirect, in addition to others terms and
conditions in this agreement and the GNU GPL, you must include the
notice contained in this paragraph or substantially equivalent
language advising other users concerning potential legal concerns.

4.  Linking ReservesDirect statically or dynamically with other
modules is making a combined work based on ReservesDirect.  Thus, the
terms and conditions of the GNU GPL, as modified by these terms and
conditions, cover the whole combination.

5.  Any distribution of ReservesDirect to a third party or any work
derived from ReservesDirect will (a) clearly identify any parts that
have been added to ReservesDirect and any parts of ReservesDirect that
have been modified; (b) will make clear that ReservesDirect is not
being downloaded from Emory University and its original developers;
and (c) will not contain any false or misleading statements, including
any false or misleading suggestions that Emory University or the
original developers of ReservesDirect have authorized or otherwise
endorsed or approved your further distribution or dissemination of
ReservesDirect or any work derived from ReservesDirect.

THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE RELEVANT ONLY IF YOU INTEND TO
MAKE SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATIONS TO THE PROGRAM OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
PROGRAM TO OTHERS.

6.  We want specified Free/Libre and Open Source Software ("FLOSS")
applications to be able to use ReservesDirect despite the fact that
not all FLOSS licenses are compatible with version 2 of the GNU GPL.
Accordingly, as a special exception to the terms and conditions of the
GNU GPL, you are free to distribute a Derivative Work (as that term is
used in copyright law) that is formed entirely from ReservesDirect and
one or more works (each, a "FLOSS Work") licensed under one or more of
the licenses listed below in section (d), as long as all the
conditions in the following sections (a) through (c) are met:
(a) You obey the GNU GPL, as modified by these Terms and Conditions,
in all respects for ReservesDirect and your Derivative Work, except
for identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which are not derived
from ReservesDirect, and which can reasonably be considered
independent and separate works in themselves.

(b) All identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which are not
derived from ReservesDirect, and which can reasonably be considered
independent and separate works in themselves,
        (i) are distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses
listed below, and
        (ii) the object code or executable form of those sections are
accompanied by the complete corresponding machine-readable source code
for those sections on the same medium and under the same FLOSS license
as the corresponding object code or executable forms of those
sections.

(c) Any works which are aggregated with ReservesDirect or with a
Derivative Work on a volume of a storage or distribution medium in
accordance with the GNU GPL, can reasonably be considered independent
and separate works in themselves which are not derivatives of either
the Program, a Derivative Work or a FLOSS Work.

Due to the many variants of some of the above licenses, in order for
this exception to the GNU GPL to apply, we require that any version
relied upon by any user of ReservesDirect follow the 2003 version of
the Free Software Foundation's Free Software Definition
(http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) or version 1.9 of the
Open Source Definition by the Open Source Initiative
(http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php).
(e) If the above conditions (a) through (d) are not met, then
ReservesDirect may only be copied, modified, distributed or used under
the terms and conditions of the GNU GPL, or with the explicit written
consent of Emory University.

(f) This FLOSS Exception applies to all Programs that contain a notice
placed by Emory University saying that the Program may be distributed
under the terms of this FLOSS Exception. If you create or distribute a
work which is a Derivative Work of both the Program and any other work
licensed under the GPL, then this FLOSS Exception is not available for
that work; thus, you must remove the FLOSS Exception notice from that
work and comply with the GPL in all respects, including by retaining
all GPL notices. You may choose to redistribute a copy of the Program
exclusively under the terms of the GPL by removing the FLOSS Exception
notice from that copy of the Program, provided that the copy has never
been modified by you or any third party.

(g) Qualified Libraries and Packages
The following is a non-exhaustive list of libraries and packages which
are covered by the FLOSS License Exception. Please note that appendix
is merely provided as an additional service to specific FLOSS projects
who wish to simplify licensing information for their users. Compliance
with one of the licenses noted under the "FLOSS license list" section
remains a prerequisite.
