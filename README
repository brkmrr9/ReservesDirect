Reserves Direct is moving!!!
============================

We're in the process of migrating Reserves Direct from svn to GitHub.  Much
of the documentation in the previous wiki was out of date and confusing so 
it has not been ported here.

When GitHub fixes it's svn import tool we plan on moving the repository here
so people can more easily clone it for local use.

For now please continue to use the subversion repository which continues
to be available at https://svn.library.emory.edu/oss/reservesdirect/
