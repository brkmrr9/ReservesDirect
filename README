Reserves Direct is moving to GitHub!!!
======================================

We're in the process of migrating Reserves Direct from svn to GitHub.  Much
of the documentation in the previous wiki was out of date and confusing so 
it has not been ported here.

There are currently no further plans for updates to ReservesDirect feel free
to fork the repository and contact other community members who may be
continuing the development effort.

The previous subversion repository is still available at 
 https://svn.library.emory.edu/oss/reservesdirect/
